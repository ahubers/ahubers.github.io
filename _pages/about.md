I am a doctoral candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa, where I'm a
member of the [Computational Logic Center](https://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/site/), advised by Dr. [J. Garrett Morris](https://jgbm.github.io/). 
I like programming languages, type theory, and language mechanization. 


My active research interest is in mechanizing row type theories in Agda. I will tentatively graduate in the Fall of 2025 and will be focusing my job search to (i) teaching focused jobs at SLACs (small/selective liberal arts colleges) in the US and (ii) post-doctoral positions in the UK & Europe.
